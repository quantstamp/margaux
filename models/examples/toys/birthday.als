/*
 * Birthday Book
 *
 * A classic Z example to explain the basic form of an Alloy model. For the original,
 * see J.M. Spivey, The Z Notation, Second Edition, Prentice Hall, 1992.
 *
 * A birthday book has two fields: known, a set of names (of persons whose birthdays are known),
 * and date, a function from known names to dates. The operation AddBirthday adds an association
 * between a name and a date; it uses the relational override operator (++), so any existing
 * mapping from the name to a date is replaced. DelBirthday removes the entry for a given name.
 * FindBirthday obtains the date d for a name n. The argument d is declared to be optional (that is,
 * a singleton or empty set), so if there is no entry for n, d will be empty. Remind gives the set
 * of names whose birthdays fall on a particular day.
 *
 * The assertion AddWorks says that if you add an entry, then look it up, you get back what you
 * just entered. DelIsUndo says that doing DelBirthday after AddBirthday undoes it, as if the add
 * had never happened. The first of these assertions is valid; the second isn't.
 *
 * The function BusyDay shows a case in which Remind produces more than one card.

/** Fikayo Modified **/

/**
* DellsUndo fails because it attempts to assert that bb1.date = bb3.date after deletion.
* This is incorrect because the birthday n->d added to bb2 could have previously existed in bb1 as n->d'
* This relation n-> d' would be replaced by n->d when added to bb2.
* However, the deletion of n would completely remove all relations from n from bb3
* As a result bb1 would still have the original relation of bb1->n->d' while bb3 would not have any relations involving n.
* Consequently, the assertion that bb1.date = bb3.date would be false with the satement above serving as a counterexample.
*
* DellsUndo2 fixes the issue and instead makes one of the following checks:
*	n->d exists in bb2.date but n does not exist in bb3.known
*	adding (or replacing) n->d to bb1.date, then removing n-> from bb1.date yields bb1.date = bb3.date
*	removing n from bb1.known is equal to bb3.known
